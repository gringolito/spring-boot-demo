Author: [Filipe Utzig](https://github.com/gringolito)

## About this project

This is a Spring Boot demo application build based on the Conference App of the course
[Spring Framework: Creating Your First Spring Boot Application](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/creating-first-spring-boot-application/)
by [Dan Bunker](https://github.com/dlbunker/). It is a Microservice that provides a couple of 
REST APIs for a conference planning platform using the following tools and technologies:

- Spring Boot Starter
- Spring Boot Web
- Spring Boot Data JPA (with Hibernate and PostgreSQL)
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Spring Boot Security
- Spring Boot Test (with JUnit and Mockito)
- Lombok
- Swagger API
- Maven

### [APIs Documentation](https://gringolito.github.io/spring-boot-demo)

The Swagger specification for the APIs of this project can be found on the
[api-docs.json](docs/api-docs.json) file.
 
The Swagger UI hosted documentation is available on [here](https://gringolito.github.io/spring-boot-demo/).

### What's next

- Use GitHub Actions to create an automated CI/CD pipeline
- Improve Spring Boot Security functionality
- Write more (useful) unit and integration tests
- Automatically update the Swagger hosted documentation along the CI/CD pipeline
